## Course Description
### EXPLORATION  
In this module we will present you with activities and examples that will allow you to expand your perception about the world and be open to new possibilities.
The explorative mindset is essential element of creativity, innovation, design and art. If you want to create solutions that will disrupt and transform your field, 
you need to nurture this mindset. We will show you how to do this in an organised way.  
### PERSPECTIVES  
This module is about taking diverse perspectives, provoking, thinking critically. If the module on exploration was about nurturing openness and curiosity, 
this one is about questioning. The purpose of this module is to develop a mindset of taking multiple perspectives in consideration when exploring a topic 
that you would like to create innovation in.  
### REFLECTION  
This module is about building capacity to process information, to synthesise and connect with your personal values, passion, needs. The process of reflection 
supports you to integrate all of the ideas, possibilities and perspectives you have been exploring. This process allows you to come up with unique new ideas, 
identify opportunities that you might have not noticed before and discover the essence (for yourself) of all the information that we are constantly flooded with.
