### Question 1
Find and share three pieces from art, philosophy, games, movies or tech, that you find inspiring and which have helped you to change the way you see and experience the world.

#### Google Glass for children with autism
The Autism Glass, a system that was developed by Stanford Medicine's Wall Lab, has become the new form of behavioral therapy to help children with autism 
distinguish between eight classical facial expressions indicating happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear, contempt or neutral. I was impressed by how the 
artificial intelligence technology can play an important role in promoting well-being and communication. This has hugely motivated me to push myself outside of my comfort zone and 
actively incorporate computational field into my education and research. 

#### Paprika (2006) & Lullaby (2019)
Paprika: a film about a therapist who enters her clients' dreams to solve their emotional struggles  
Lallaby: a song about the one in the dream, not a person who is dreaming  
All of the arts, including Paprika and Lullaby, that discuss the topic of "dream" have made me question: if a recurring nightmare can be reshaped in virtual environment, 
how effectively would it alter one's perspective? Can this approach also apply to help people cope with traumatic memories or phobia?

### Question 2
As you commute or move around the city within different spaces during the day, look for weird relations between objects. Pay attention to things like faces, letters, connections that may emerge where they were not meant to be. Look for all the things that go together that were not intended to go together. 
Document them and train your mind in seeing new connections.  

#### Experimenting with incompatible ingredients
This is my second week in Amsterdam, and being new to Amsterdam has actually allowed me to discover something new. When I go to the market where the product descriptions are 
all is in Dutch, I often buy wrong items (e.g. getting ketchup instead of tomato sauce for pasta). However, thanks to my mistake, I'm learning to experiment how to make 
food taste good with seemingly incompatible ingredients.
